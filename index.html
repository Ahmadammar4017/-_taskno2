            Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, was a key figure in the Indian independence movement. He advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience to achieve political and social progress. His philosophy of nonviolent resistance inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

            Gandhi led various campaigns for civil rights, social reforms, and ultimately, the independence of India from British rule. His commitment to truth, nonviolence, and self-discipline earned him the title of "Mahatma," which means "great soul."

            Throughout his life, Gandhi emphasized the importance of living a simple and truthful life. He believed in the power of compassion and tolerance, and his teachings continue to inspire people globally.
